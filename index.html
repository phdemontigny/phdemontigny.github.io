		Computer Science Master's Student at the University of Waterloo <br \> 
		<strong>Email:</strong> phdemontigny [at] gmail.com
		<br /><br />
		I am a recent graduate from Williams College who enjoys learning so much that I decided to come back for more. I like to study interesting applications of mathematics, including computational geometry and machine learning. I also enjoy playing both computer and board games, participating in Magic the Gathering tournaments, training in Muay Thai, competing in intramural squash, and learning Japanese.

		<h2>About This Site</h2>
		This site is where I will post all of the papers, projects, and games I have worked on over the past few years. There's plenty of cool stuff here, so feel free to look around! I will be updating this site regularly, and I am open to all kinds of feedback!

		<strong>Tech:</strong> Python <br> <br>
		I have recently started exploring the various single and multiplayer programming challenges featured on codingame.com. I have always likened programming to a heavily abstracted strategy game, so this website is a perfect fit for me. I plan on participating in as many of the multiplayer programming contests as possible in the coming months. <br>
		<br>
		The last challenge I completed was the "There is No Spoon" contest in April, 2015. I finished 81% of the 4 hour challenge and placed 117/1628 globally.

<h2>Magic the Gathering Price Predictor</h2>

		<strong>Tech:</strong> Python, Scikit-Learn, Random Forests <br> <br>
		This project was completed as part of a graduate course in Applied Machine Learning in the Fall of 2014. I investigated the viability of using Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the price of Magic the Gathering (MTG) cards using only the information contained in each individual card. In doing so, I hoped to predict which cards would be worth the most before they even became available. The results of my analysis suggested that even after 20 years of MTG, there are still too few cards in the higher price range to create a strong enough prediction algorithm using standard machine learning techniques.

		<strong>Tech:</strong> Java, Python, Fuego, Neural Networks <br> <br>
		As part of the Artificial Intelligence final project in December of 2013, my partners Simon Chase, Daniel Seita, and I created a simple program that plays the game of Go over the course of about two weeks. The program uses a neural net implementation that we trained using transcripts from professional games on 9Ã—9 boards. The final product succeeded in that it was able to learn a non-random strategy. My role in this project was to design and program the input generator, to write the script that trained the neural net, and to create a basic Go player for presentation purposes.

		<strong>Tech:</strong> Javascript, GIMP <br> <br>
		This game was my second creation from the <a href="http://http://machinisludo.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">Machinis Ludo</a> 48 hour game-jam in January of 2015. Inspired by titles such as Flappy Bird and Candy Crush, I modified the rules of Set to create a game that was both very challenging and very addicting. I hope to release this game as a mobile app in Google Play sometime soon.

		<strong>Note:</strong> All sound files were borrowed from The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, another fantastic game.

		This game was my first creation from the <a href="http://http://machinisludo.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">Machinis Ludo</a> 48 hour game-jam hosted by Professor Morgan McGuire in April of 2013. My goal with Constellations was to create a game that teaches graph theory and mathematical thinking through a series of thought-provoking puzzles. The game's main feature is the unlockable "challenge problems," many of which do not have solutions. This forces the player to prove to themselves which challenges are not solvable, as the game will never tell them.

		A simple ray tracer implementation in C++ that draws scenes as specified in lua files. It has the following features, which can be seen in the generated image to the left.
		<ul>
			<li> Draws primitives such as spheres and boxes as well as triangular meshes.
			<li> Uses the Phong Reflection Model to calculate aggregate color intensity from multiple light sources.
			<li> Accurately renders shadows and specular highlights.
			<li> Models mirrored surfaces using recursively generated reflected rays.
			<li> Simple drawing acceleration implemented using bounding spheres.

		<strong>Tech:</strong> JavaScript, WebGL, THREE.js <br> <br>
		A horror-survival game in which the player is being chased through a forest by the Weeping Angel characters from the Dr. Who television series. The goal of the game is to turn on all of the lanterns in the forest without letting the angels sneak up on you. This project was inspired by the game "Slender: The Eight Pages," and attempts to create a similarly creepy experience for the player. It was implemented entirely in Javascript using the THREE.js WebGL API. The Weeping Forest took third place in the final project competition for my computer graphics class.
